## UFO Sightings


## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to help Dana create a webpage that made it easy for users to search about UFO sightings.  A webpage which was asked to be generated also needed to have different search criteria in case a user was searching for a particular UFO sighting.  Dana also asked to make the webpage easy to navigate for the user.

## Results

After learning what Dana wanted on her webpage and how user-friendly she wanted it to be, the webpage was created and it was straightforward.  The user just had to type in the specific box of what he/she was searching and the table would filter out anything the user was not looking for.  The different search criteria which are available for the user are: the date, the city, the state, the country, and the shape of the UFO.  The user can search with just one of those options or as many as he/she wants.

## Summary

Dana seemed to be satisfied with the webpage that was developed for her.  There are two recommendations we made to her.  One suggestion was that she can add another search criteria option.  The option was the duration of the sighting.  The other recommendation we made was that she can also search by key words from comments that were made during the sightings.
